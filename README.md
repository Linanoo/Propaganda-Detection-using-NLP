# Propaganda-Detection-using-NLP
Developed binary and multi-class classifiers to detect and categorize propaganda techniques in text. Used Bag-of-Words with logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT for contextual classification. Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrices. BERT significantly outperformed traditional methods in handling nuanced language.
